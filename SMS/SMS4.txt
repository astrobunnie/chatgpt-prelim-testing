there is problem with case 0 where the menu will be outputted inifitely. can you fix this problem of case 0?
--------------------------
To fix the problem with case 0 where the menu will be outputted infinitely, you can add a condition to check whether the user has already selected an option before displaying the menu again. Here's the updated code for case 0:

swift
Copy code
case 0:
    if (choice != 0) {
        printf("\nInvalid choice. Please try again.\n");
    }
    break;


With this update, if the user enters 0 as their choice, the program will check whether choice is equal to 0, and if it's not, it will display the "Invalid choice. Please try again." message and go back to the menu. If choice is equal to 0, the program will simply exit the switch statement and display the menu again.
--------------------------
case 0 should actually be the case in which the menu is printed out, and prompts the user to select another choice. but currently case 0 prints out the menu infinitely.
--------------------------
I see. In that case, you can remove the choice = 0 statement from all the other cases and add it to the end of the case 0 block. This way, after the user selects an option, the program will always go back to the menu and prompt the user to select another option. Here's the updated code for case 0:

swift
Copy code
case 0:
    // display menu
    printf("\nStudent Management System\n");
    printf("0. Main Menu\n");
    printf("1. Add Student\n");
    printf("2. Delete Student\n");
    printf("3. Display Students\n");
    printf("4. Add Grade\n");
    printf("5. Change students capacity \n");
    printf("6. Exit\n");
    printf("Enter your choice: ");
    scanf("%d", &choice);
    break;


With this update, when the user enters 0 as their choice, the program will display the menu and prompt the user to select another option. After the user selects another option, the program will execute that option and then go back to the menu again.
